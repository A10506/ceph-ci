---------

* The maximum number of PGs per OSD before the monitor issues a
  warning has been reduced from 300 to 200 PGs.  200 is still twice
  the generally recommended target of 100 PGs per OSD.  This limit can
  be adjusted via the ``mon_pg_warn_max_per_osd`` option on the
  monitors.

* Creating pools or adjusting pg_num will now fail if the change would
  make the number of PGs per OSD exceed the configured
  ``mon_pg_warn_max_per_osd`` limit.  The option can be adjusted if it
  is really necessary to create a pool with more PGs.
